        <h1>Welcome to MightyMind's!</h1>
       
        <p> MightyMinds is an NFT project for those who have great ideas, positive minds and are looking for a long term investment.   </p>
        <p> This NFT project is not intended to see much profit in the short term, unless you get lucky winning a giveaway ;) </p>
          <p>   However it is 100% a great long term investment.  </p>
       
        <p> We are planning on releasing a collection of 10 000 NFTs. </p>
        
        <p> Our goal for the future, once our company has grown and expanded is to give the owners of a MightyMind the best utilities as we possibly can, such as monthly crypto giveaways, all expenses paid for vacation giveaways, gym membership discounts, restaurant discounts, clothing discounts, and one day we plan on paying out dividends from all investments funded by MightyMind to each individual MightyMind owner.  </p>
       
        <p>  We plan on investing all capital generated through this NFT project into properties, gyms, franchises, and most importantly, we plan on investing in some great ideas our fellow MightyMind owners have and which we think are worth an investment. </p>
       
        <p>     This project will also allow the owners of a MightyMind NFT to share their ideas or companies with all other owners which they may assist in any way possible. </p>
        <p>  For example: 
        <p>  You are selling a product and another owner has a following of 10 000 people on Instagram. You can make an arrangement with that owner to send them a product for free, and in return they do a review on your product and post it to their following audience. In this way you get more potential audience to your product and In return, the other who had an arrangement with you will get  a free product and a potential business alliance.  </p>
        <p>   YOU CAN BE CREATIVE WITH THIS !
       
        <p>  No matter how big or small your idea, we are all MightyMind’s so let’s support each other, spread love and spread positivity.
